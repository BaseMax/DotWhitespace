# DotWhitespace

DotWhitespace is an esoteric programming language developed by Max Base. It was released on 17 July 2020. Its name is a reference to whitespace and dot characters. Unlike most programming languages, which ignore or assign little meaning to most whitespace characters, the DotWhitespace interpreter ignores any non-whitespace characters. Only spaces, tabs, dot, and linefeeds have meaning. A consequence of this property is that a Whitespace program can easily be contained within the whitespace characters of a program written in another language, except possibly in languages which depend on spaces for syntax validity such as Python, making the text a polyglot.

### Examples

```
input+='. . .  .   .\t. .  .   .\n'
DEFINE abcd ('STR', 'abcd')

input+='. . .  .   .\t\t. .  .   .\n'
DEFINE abcd ('VAR', 'abcd')

input+='. . .  .   .\t  .   .    . .\n'
DEFINE abcd ('NUM', 1230)

input+='.. \t. .  .   .\n'
PRINT ('VAR', 'abcd')

input+='.. . .  .   .\n'
PRINT ('STR', 'abcd')

input+='..   . .\n'
PRINT ('NUM', 10)

input+='..   . . .\t   . .\n'
PRINT ('NUM', 120)

input+='..   . . \t   . \n'
PRINT ('NUM', 120)
```
