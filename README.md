# DotWhitespace

DotWhitespace is an esoteric programming language developed by Max Base. It was released on 17 July 2020. Its name is a reference to whitespace and dot characters. Unlike most programming languages, which ignore or assign little meaning to most whitespace characters, the DotWhitespace interpreter ignores any non-whitespace characters. Only spaces, tabs, dot, and linefeeds have meaning. A consequence of this property is that a Whitespace program can easily be contained within the whitespace characters of a program written in another language, except possibly in languages which depend on spaces for syntax validity such as Python, making the text a polyglot.

### Examples

`. . .  .   .\t. .  .   .\n`
DEFINE abcd ('STR', 'abcd')

`. . .  .   .\t\t. .  .   .\n``
DEFINE abcd ('VAR', 'abcd')

`. . .  .   .\t  .   .    . .\n`
DEFINE abcd ('NUM', 1230)

`.. \t. .  .   .\n`
PRINT ('VAR', 'abcd')

`.. . .  .   .\n`
PRINT ('STR', 'abcd')

`..   . .\n`
PRINT ('NUM', 10)

`..   . . .\t   . .\n`
PRINT ('NUM', 120)

`..   . . \t   . \n`
PRINT ('NUM', 120)
```
